Java Application Archetype
##########################

Application packaging focuses on how your application is launched (via a ``bash`` or ``bat`` script), how dependencies
are managed and how configuration and other auxiliary files are included in the final distributable. The `JavaAppPackaging` archetype
provides a default application structure and executable scripts to launch your application. 

Additionally there is :doc:`Server Packaging </archetypes/java_server/index>` which provides platform-specific
functionality for installing your application in server environments. You can customize specific debian and rpm packaging
for a variety of platforms and init service loaders including Upstart, System V and SystemD (experimental).

Features
--------

The `JavaAppPackaging` archetype contains the following features.

* Default application mappings (no fat jar)
* Executable bash/bat script
